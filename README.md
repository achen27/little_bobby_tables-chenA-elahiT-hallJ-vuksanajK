## Dependencies
You must have the Python module "flask" installed
In a terminal:

You can get around this by creating a virtual environment:
```
   python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>
```
To activate the virtual environment (MacOS or Linux):
```
   $ . <name_of_venv>/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment (MacOS or Linux):
```
   $ deactivate
```

## Run
1. If you installed Flask on a virtual environment, activate the environment
2. Clone the Repository
3. Run
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```
