SQLITE INNER JOIN
The INNER JOIN clause in SQLITE is used to query two or more tables that share
the same column. If the values in the columns are the same, then a new set is
created with the selected columns to join on the outside and the same column in
between, hence the name INNER JOIN.
This can be helpful in our project to link our different tables in out database.
We can use INNER JOIN to create a set of rows that contains edits for a
particular story. This would help with out modify stories method.
